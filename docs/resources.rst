* `Sphinx Getting Started <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html>`_
* `Sphinx tutorial <https://sphinx-tutorial.readthedocs.io/>`_

To write more effective software documentation generally, here are some useful sites:

* The `18F Content Guide <https://content-guide.18f.gov/>`_ houses best practices for software documentation focused on user experiences and needs, particularly as related to government websites.
* `Write the Docs <https://www.writethedocs.org/>`_, a community focused on communication and documentation, has a `catalog of learning resources <https://www.writethedocs.org/about/learning-resources/>`_ (including videos and tutorials) as well as a robust `documentation guide <https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/>`_. This community also has a `GitHub repo <https://github.com/writethedocs>`_.
* `Docs as Code <https://www.docslikecode.com/>`_ provides resources for development teams to build documentation repeatably and consistently across multiple platforms.
* The `Documentation System <https://documentation.divio.com/>`_ emphasizes four types of documentation: tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference, and explanation documents. The site provides examples of and tips for each.
* The `Good Docs Project <https://thegooddocsproject.dev/>`_, to which you can `contribute <https://thegooddocsproject.dev/contribute>`_, includes templates and writing instructions for documenting open source software. The organization's templates go through a rigorous writing, reviewing, and refining process.
* The `Beautiful Docs repo <https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs>`_ has a list of language- and program-specific documentation resources.
